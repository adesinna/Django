When you click a link on  your web page, the  application (web browser) sends a request through a socket(port)
and the server sends back the page needed through the same port the browser to be displayed.

Hyper Text Transfer Protocol(HTTP)
    These are the set of rules that browsers use to talk to web servers.

Network Sockets:
    The application will talk to another application using sockets



Ports:
    They are like extensions attached to the ip.
