Apps:
    Suppose you have a website that consists of a blog, forum and comments, each part of this website could be an app
    in django

    When you create an app, it creates a directory with a bunch of files that the app will need.

    views.py:
        This is where the response of the request of the user is processed, and served back to the client.
        They are written as python function.



    To create an app:
        python manage.py startapp app1


        - go to app/views.py
            create your views as a function

        - create a file called urls.py in the app directory

            create the urlpatterns in the app/urls.py file

        - go to project/urls.py and include the app url


    How Django works:
        A request go to the root_config in the project settings, which its value is always project.urls
        next it redirects it to the appropriate app urls.py where it will fetch the view that is associated with it.
