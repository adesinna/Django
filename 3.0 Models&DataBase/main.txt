Every site you see has data, like the way POLOM site has images, and they are all stored in a database.

What are Models?
    Models are the blueprint which can be used to create database tables
    Models are nothing but classes in Python
    Models are created in the models.py file
    To create a database table called Students, which will consist of all the student data on the website. We are to
    create a class called Student in the models.py file.


    Installed_APPS in settings are the apps that are connected to the database tables.
    To connect them to the database table you need to run:

        python manage.py migrate

    To create a database
        - go to model and create the model class

        - register the app in the INSTALLED_APPS in settings
            go to apps and copy the class name associated with your app
            then go add app1.apps.App1Config #the class name in apps in App1Config

        - tell django you have made migrations
            python manage.py makemigrations (app_name)

        - tell python to create the table in the database
            python manage.py migrate


    Adding data to the database table

        Using Python Shell
            - python manage.py shell
            - from app1.models import Item
            - Item.objects.all() # shows you all the rows in the table
            - a = Item(item_name="Pizza", item_description="suya on pizza", item_price=50) # state the attribute explicitly
            - a.save() # to save the item
            - a.pk or a.id will automatically be created in the database
            - Item.objects.values() # in a better json  format
            - after creating the method for it to return strings when all is called in the database. logout and login into the shell



    You can use django admin interface to manage the database instead of using shell

    Create superuser
        python manage.py createsuperuser

        go to app/admin.py and register the model

        go to
            http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

            You will be able



    You can view the Item in the database in view
        go to view

        import the class from .models

        item_list = Item.objects.all()
