Static files are used to style your html in django.

- create a folder called static/app1 in the app folder
- create your styling
- then go to index.hmtl and follow the load


Because a project might have different apps there are some basic templates that is needed across the apps, example
like navbar.

    Create a template called base.html

    use bootstrap, index.html and base.html, item.html



Adding image fields

    Go to model and add the image attributes
    give the image as a link in the field and give a default
    apply migrations to store in database
        python manage.py makemigrations app1

        python manage.py migrate app1

    src="{{ item.item_image}}
